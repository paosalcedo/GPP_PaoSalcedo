Install instructions:

The "Torque3D"-folder contains the game-ready files and they can be extracted with the given folder structure into your
Torque3D-project mainfolder and everything will be in its place. You can also unzip the folders to where you want by hand,
but then you will possibly have to correct the filepaths by hand later.
If you get prompted when unzipping, if you want to overwrite files like materials.cs or forest\brushes.cs you can do that if
you use a fresh or empty project, otherwise you can open the .cs file in notepad and copy over the content into your existing
file or set the models up again in the ingame editor.

The "source"-folder contains the source files, so if you want to edit something, use it to create something new or use it for
another engine, it will likely be better to use these versions. The .blend files are opened with blender, so if you use blender 
these will be more comfortable to use, otherwise the .dae versions can also be imported and .xcf files are for gimp.
Also added the screenshots used for making the skybox and the heightmap and layer masks for creating the terrain where I
took the screenshots for the skybox, so if you want to create another version of the skybox, this may be useful.

Tested with a version of Torque3D 3.0
