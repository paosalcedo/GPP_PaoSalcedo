Hello everyone.

This sample pack contains Roland Sound Canvas Acoustic Grand Piano
samples from the Roland SCC-1 MIDI sound card. The piano samples span C2
through C9 in one octave steps. The amplitudes have NOT been maximized
to retain the relative volume of each sound. Also, some attempt has
been made to reduce sample length but they were allowed to ring out
a little. Users of these samples are, of course, free to edit them
to suit their needs.
 
Although the samples are in .wav format, they can be ported to .smp, 
.raw or almost any other using a program such as Cool Edit or Goldwave.

Technical Specs:

All samples are 44.1kHz, 16 bit and were created by playing
different acoustic grand piano notes on the Roland SCC-1, and capturing 
them live using a Turtle Beach Multisound. Post editing was done 
remove the dead space and to control the sample length.
